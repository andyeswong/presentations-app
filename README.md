## Security

### HTTPS Enforcement

The application will automatically enforce HTTPS when running in production environments. This is controlled through the following environment variables in your `.env` file:

```
APP_ENV=production  # Set to 'production' or 'prod' to activate HTTPS enforcement
FORCE_HTTPS=true    # Can be set to false to disable HTTPS enforcement even in production
```

The HTTPS enforcement adds several security headers:
- Strict-Transport-Security (HSTS)
- X-Content-Type-Options
- X-XSS-Protection
- X-Frame-Options
- Referrer-Policy

To configure these security features, you can modify the `config/security.php` file.
